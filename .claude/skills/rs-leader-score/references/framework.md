# RS Leader Setup framework: rules, formulas and sources

Source: "Conversation with Kushal" podcast, guest Himanshu (CMT/CFTe/MSTA, full-time swing/positional
trader since 2022, holds stocks a few weeks to a few months). Timestamps refer to that transcript.
The speaker's own idea is to raise the _probability_ of winning and make each bet _asymmetric_:
the coin stays 50/50 but the payoff changes (5:08-8:17).

## 1. The four-stage funnel

| Stage       | What happens                                                                               | Output                      | Script                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0. Market   | Breadth tells you how hard to press                                                        | Regime + risk per trade     | `score_setup.py --market-only` |
| 1. Universe | ~2,500 NSE stocks -> RS80 scan -> 150-265 names                                            | Shortlist + industry counts | `compute_rs.py`                |
| 2. Chart    | Keep names forming a base, about to emerge -> 20-40                                        | Technical inputs            | `chart_metrics.py`             |
| 3. Theme    | Group them by industry, keep the strongest groups and the first 1-2 names in each -> 15-20 | Group count, leader rank    | `compute_rs.py` + judgement    |
| 4. Catalyst | Read presentation / con-call for the earnings trigger -> final 10-15                       | Catalyst fields             | research                       |
| Score       | All of the above -> 0-100 + class + trade plan                                             | Report                      | `score_setup.py`               |

(Funnel described 37:36-40:27, 49:20-50:07 and 1:03:31-1:03:54.)

## 2. Market health

"Three out of four stocks follow the general market" (O'Neil, 9:39). In a poor market the win rate
falls to 20-30% and average gains shrink; in a healthy one it rises to 60-70% (10:35-10:54, 16:47-17:20).

| Penalty: `index_near_high_breadth_falling` | index at highs while breadth falls                                      | -10     | 13:24 (Jan-Feb 2020: Nifty highs on Reliance + HDFC Bank only) |

Regimes (risk per trade / max position): HEALTHY >= 70 (1% / 30%), NEUTRAL 50-69 (0.5% / 20%),
WEAK 30-49 (0.25% / 10%), HOSTILE < 30 (0.25% / 10%, pilots only). The speaker's standard size is
10%, going to 25-30% with only 5-6 stocks in a healthy market (1:33:34).

Weak markets are _not_ a reason to stop scanning. They are when the RS scan is shortest (100-120
names) and the true leaders are easiest to see: Laurus Labs made an all-time high on 23 Apr 2020, a
month after the Nifty low, then rose ~700% (51:20-51:46; 1:05:09-1:05:40).

## 3. Gates: the RS80 scan

All must pass, otherwise the stock is REJECTED (1:11:55 shows the live scan).

| Gate                  | Threshold                  | Why                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `price_above_200dma`  | true                       | "If it can't beat its own 200-day average, how will it become a multibagger?" (33:31) |
| `rs_rating`           | >= 80                      | top 20% of the market (28:53-29:29)                                                   |
| `avg_turnover_30d_cr` | >= 10 Cr (7 Cr soft floor) | liquidity (33:40)                                                                     |
| `market_cap_cr`       | >= 500 Cr                  | excludes illiquid microcaps (33:15)                                                   |
| `price`               | >= Rs 10                   | (33:59)                                                                               |

**RS rating.** Rank every listed stock by 3-month return, convert to a percentile:
`rating = clip(100 - ceil(rank_from_top / N x 100), 1, 99)`. Top 1% = 99, top 2% = 98 (25:39-28:46).
Three months is the chosen window: 12 months is too late, 1 week catches news-driven junk
(26:28-27:42, citing Faber 2010 and Jegadeesh-Titman 1993). Weighted 3/6/9/12 is offered as an option.

Myth addressed (29:06): RS 80 does not mean "already missed it". A stock that merely holds flat while
the index falls also earns a high rating; STL was RS 91 at Rs 125 and still RS 99 at Rs 1,000.

## 4. Pillar rules and formulas (100 points)

### A. Relative strength - 15

| Rule                  | Bands                                | Source                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rs_rating`           | 95+ = 12, 90+ = 10, 85+ = 8, 80+ = 6 | O'Neil: past US winners averaged RS 87 at the start (32:46)                                                 |
| `rs_resisted_decline` | 3 if true                            | Darvas "stocks that resisted the tide" (32:22); "the whole neighbourhood burned, our house stood" (1:17:32) |

`chart_metrics.py` tests the second rule: during the index's worst drawdown (>= 5%) in the last
126 sessions, did the stock lose less than half as much?

### B. Technical template of past winners - 30

"Study past winners, rewind their charts" (19:44-22:43). Common ingredients (34:44-36:33, 1:05:48):

| Rule                    | Formula                                                                      | Bands                             | Source                                                                              |

| `base_length_weeks`     | sideways stretch (range <= 30%) before the advance                           | 26+ = 5, 8+ = 4, 4+ = 3           | "long base, minimum one month" (1:01:55, 1:05:56)                                   |
| `stop_distance_pct`     | (pivot - base low) / pivot x 100, i.e. depth of the tight right side         | <=5 = 8, <=6 = 7, <=8 = 5, >8 = 0 | stop 5-8% max; ">8% is not a proper base" (1:08:54)                                 |
| `volume_dryup_ratio`    | avg vol last 10 / last 50                                                    | <=0.6 = 4, <=0.8 = 3, <=1.0 = 1   | "volume dries up" in the right side (44:04, 1:06:29)                                |
| `volume_spike_ratio`    | max vol last 60 / avg vol last 120                                           | 3x = 3, 2x = 2, 1.5x = 1          | "skyscrapers" = institutions (44:20); Darvas "sleeping stock wakes up" (1:20:35)    |
| `ema50_breaches`        | runs of >= 2 closes below EMA50 since the advance began                      | 0 = 3, 1 = 1                      | "a strong stock doesn't breach the 50 EMA" (41:30, 1:21:15)                         |
| `fall_to_recover_ratio` | sessions spent falling / sessions to retrace it                              | 6+ = 2, 3+ = 1                    | STL fell ~1 year, came back in ~1 month; SAN DLM 2 years vs 2 months (38:27, 47:45) |

### C. Stage / timing - 15

| Rule            | Bands                                               | Source                                                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `leg_number`    | 1 = 11, 2 = 9, 3 = 4, 4+ = 0                        | "catch it in the first or second leg" (36:02, 43:24); 3rd-5th leg = trade only (1:19:55) |
| `rest_days`     | <=20 = 2, <=40 = 1                                  | a leader with a strong catalyst rests 15-20 days, not 2-4 months (55:52-56:54)           |
| `market_cap_cr` | 1,000-10,000 Cr = 2; 500-1,000 or 10,000-20,000 = 1 | "more room to grow" (36:33-37:28)                                                        |

### D. Theme & group leadership - 20

| Rule                       | Bands                                                                   | Source                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `group_count_in_scan`      | names from the same industry in the RS80 scan: 6+ = 8, 4-5 = 6, 2-3 = 3 | "7-8 aerospace names = strong theme" (49:43-49:58); identify the theme and 80% of homework is done (55:19) |
| `leader_rank_in_group`     | 1st = 6, 2nd = 5, 3rd = 2                                               | "only the first and second name" (53:01); STL before HFCL, Mazagon before Cochin (52:13-54:43)             |
| `theme_revenue_share_pct`  | % of revenue from the theme: 40+ = 4, 20+ = 3, 10+ = 1                  | Paramount: OFC only 2% of revenue, didn't work (53:54)                                                     |
| `global_peer_confirmation` | global peer/customer already a multibagger                              | Corning/Lumentum for STL (30:44); Bloom Energy for MTAR (46:11); AXTI (39:42)                              |

Leader rank: `compute_rs.py` ranks by RS inside the industry as a proxy. The speaker's real test is
_who moved / made a new high first_ after a market low; check the charts and override if they differ.

### E. Catalyst & earnings - 20

"Price is the slave of earnings" (22:10). A catalyst is the trigger that will lift earnings, and
management will advertise it loudly in presentations and con-calls (50:07, 1:28:30, 1:29:42).

| Rule                          | Formula                                                      | Bands                       | Source                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pat_growth_yoy_pct`          | latest quarter PAT vs same quarter last year                 | 50+ = 5, 25+ = 4, 10+ = 2   | earnings back the move (1:03:46)                                     |
| `sales_growth_yoy_pct`        | TTM or quarterly YoY                                         | 25+ = 3, 15+ = 2, 5+ = 1    | JG Chemicals 840 -> 973 Cr (1:23:07)                                 |
| `catalyst_revenue_uplift_pct` | revenue the new capex/orders can add / current revenue x 100 | 50+ = 5, 25+ = 4, 10+ = 2   | JG: 50 Cr capex done adds 400-450 Cr on ~900 Cr (1:25:40)            |
| `catalyst_months_to_impact`   | months until commissioning / order execution                 | <=6 = 3, <=12 = 2, <=24 = 1 | "H1 FY27, active in 6 months" (1:25:30)                              |
| `quantified_guidance`         | management gives numeric targets (EBITDA, revenue, mix)      | 2                           | "throw it far" - big projections make stocks move (50:17, 1:27:15)   |
| `upcycle_quarters_elapsed`    | consecutive strong-earnings quarters so far                  | <=4 = 2, <=6 = 1            | strong runs last ~6-8 quarters, then the top comes (1:00:27-1:00:48) |

Useful derived check for capex stories: **asset turnover of the capex** = potential revenue / capex
(JG: 900 / 100 = 9x). Note it in evidence; high turnover makes the uplift credible.

On verifying management claims (1:26:20-1:27:50): the speaker does not try to prove projections.
Rising price on heavy volume means better-informed institutions did their research; the stop-loss
is the protection if the story is wrong. Record the claim and the source anyway.

## 5. Caps, leg logic and classification

Caps (score can't exceed the cap):

- `loose_base`: stop_distance_pct > 8 -> max 59.
- `theme_tourist`: theme_revenue_share_pct < 10 -> max 59.
- `weak_vs_50ema`: ema50_breaches > 1 -> max 69.

Leg logic: if `leg_number` is missing it is derived from `gain_from_base_low_pct`
(<=60% = 1, <=100% = 2, <=150% = 3, else 4). If both exist, the later leg wins and a flag is raised.
Anchors: STL at Rs 125 after a 25-30% move "is not late" (31:08); Bliss GVS 200 -> 650 "already
took many legs" (1:16:27); MTAR 2400 -> 9000 is trade-only (1:21:30).

Missing data: rules with null inputs are excluded. Two scores are always computed, both after caps:
re-based (points earned / points available x 100) and conservative (missing = 0). At 70%+ coverage
the headline is the re-based score; below that it is the conservative score, because re-basing a
handful of strong facts can produce a misleading 90-100 (found when scoring Laurus 2020 from four
facts in the talk).

Word inputs: where a source only describes a feature ("volume bahut zyada", "tight base"), enter the
word. `framework_config.json -> qualitative` maps it to the floor of its band and the field is tagged
qualitative. Unknown words raise an error instead of guessing.

Below 70% coverage any non-REJECT class is shown as "INSUFFICIENT DATA (n% coverage) - provisional:
<class>", so strong-but-unverified names stay distinguishable from weak ones. Below 20% coverage
the provisional grade is withheld ("too little data to grade").

In WEAK/HOSTILE markets BUY classes get "pilot size only".

Holding alerts (not scored, for existing positions): price below the 50 EMA (the trailing exit,
41:30), RS below 80, and a late leg combined with a loose base.

## 6. Trade plan and position sizing

- Entry = pivot (high of the tight consolidation). If price is already above the pivot, entry =
  price, which widens the stop and shrinks size (1:34:00).
- Stop = consolidation low (technical default; Minervini school). Aggressive alternative = breakout
  day low (Dan Zanger: "winning horses don't come back to the gates"), sized at 0.25% risk
  (1:07:45-1:08:16, 1:35:13).
- `stop_pct = (entry - stop) / entry x 100`
- **Position size % = risk% x 100 / stop%**. At 1% risk: 100 / stop% (1:31:01). 5% stop -> 20%
  position -> 1% portfolio loss if wrong. Beginners: 0.5% or 0.25% risk, or start with half and add
  once the stock proves itself (1:32:41).
- Target default = entry x (1 + 5 x stop%) (the 1:5 coin game). Flag if below 4R.
- Exit: trail on a daily close below the 50 EMA; don't exit on valuation, "there is no limit to how
  mad the market can get" (41:06-43:50, Tata Elxsi 900 -> 7000+ with "overvalued" threads all the way).

## 7. Edge from your journal

`Edge = (win% / loss%) x (avg gain% / avg loss%)` (16:32). This equals the profit factor.
< 1 losing, 1-2 thin, > 2 good; the speaker's is 3.8. Example: 50% win rate, 20% avg gain, 5% avg
loss -> edge 4. `edge_calc.py` computes it from a CSV of trade P&L %, plus expectancy per trade.

## 8. Deliberately left out, and known weaknesses

- Valuation (P/E) is not scored: the speaker explicitly exits on stops, not valuation.
- Leg counting and base quality are partly visual; the gain-from-base-low proxy is conservative but
  crude. Look at the chart.
- RS rating needs the full universe. A rating computed on a small universe is not comparable.
- The examples in `assets/examples/` are reconstructions from the talk with ASSUMED placeholders.
  They test the logic, not real-world performance. The framework has not been back-tested here.
